🍿 Netflix Recommendation System Project 🍿



🎨 Project Overview

The Netflix Recommendation System Project aims to predict and recommend personalized movie and TV show suggestions for users. By using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques, the system identifies patterns in user preferences to provide accurate recommendations. This project showcases the use of machine learning, data preprocessing, and user personalization in real-world applications.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of user interaction data and metadata of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. Key features in the dataset include:

🎥 Movie/Show Title
📆 Release Year
🎭 Genre
⭐ IMDB/Rating
📄 Description (Synopsis of the movie/show)
🕒 Duration (Runtime of the content)
👥 Cast (Actors and directors)
💻 User Interaction (Watch history, ratings, and reviews)
🌐 Project Objectives
🔍 Data Collection & Cleaning: Process user interactions, ratings, and movie metadata.
📊 Data Exploration: Visualize data to identify user behavior and viewing trends.
💡 Feature Engineering: Generate user profiles and item profiles.
🤖 Model Development: Use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.
🔍 Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and Hit Ratio.

🔁 Project Workflow

📖 Data Collection: Import Netflix user interaction and metadata.
📁 Data Cleaning: Handle missing data and inconsistencies in user interaction logs.
📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze user preferences, top-rated content, and popular genres.
🎨 Feature Engineering: Create features such as user similarity matrices and item embeddings.
🤖 Model Training: Train models like Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Recommenders.
🔍 Model Evaluation: Measure performance using metrics such as Precision@K, Recall@K, and NDCG.
📊 Recommendations & Insights: Generate personalized recommendations for new users and existing users.

🧰 Technologies Used

💻 Programming Language: Python
📊 Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
💡 Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Surprise, LightFM, TensorFlow/Keras
📊 Model Evaluation: Precision, Recall, NDCG, Hit Ratio
🌐 Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or local IDEs
🔄 Usage
📊 Data Exploration: Run the EDA section to visualize user preferences and content trends.
📦 Train the Model: Train collaborative, content-based, and hybrid recommendation models.
🍿 Get Recommendations: Generate personalized recommendations for a specific user or content.

📊 Results & Insights

The best-performing model was Hybrid Recommender, which achieved a X% improvement in NDCG compared to standalone models.

Collaborative filtering performed well for users with abundant history, while content-based filtering provided better recommendations for new users (cold start problem).

🌀 Visualization: Heatmaps, bar plots, and user-item interaction matrices were used to visualize content similarities and user preferences.

💡 Possible Improvements
🌈 User Profiling: Improve user profiles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on content descriptions.
📚 Model Tuning: Use Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
🚀 Model Deployment: Deploy the recommendation engine as a web application.
